# ADR-004: Issue, Branching and CI Strategy for Auth and Order Creation

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The issue "Backend: Order creation endpoint + serialization (TDD)" defines
a core backend capability but spans multiple architectural layers and
prerequisites.

Authentication is a hard dependency for order creation, but must remain
independent, testable, and evolvable on its own.

To avoid mixed concerns, partial closures, and fragile integration,
the work is decomposed into a hierarchy of issues that mirror architectural
layers and development phases.

This ADR documents:
- the issue hierarchy
- the branching strategy
- and the CI/CD strategy used to protect completed auth features

---

## Decision

Issues are used as architectural units, not as simple task lists.

The original issue is treated as a long-lived epic.
Implementation happens only in focused child and leaf issues.

Authentication is implemented as a prerequisite subtree under the order epic.

## Issue Hierarchy

### Epic (Root Issue)

**Backend: Order creation endpoint + serialization (TDD)**

Role:
- Defines the long-term backend goal (order creation)
- Links ADRs and architectural decisions
- Acts as a coordination anchor

Constraints:
- Not expected to be fully implemented or closed directly
- No direct development branches

---

### Parent Issue (Auth Coordination)

**Backend: Auth login TDD (0 / 1)**

Role:
- Declares authentication as a prerequisite for order creation
- Groups all auth-related work
- Defines boundaries between layers

This issue remains open until all auth sub-issues are completed.
